# Self-driving Cars: Lateral and Longitudinal Control

As the final project of Introduction to Self-Driving Cars from Coursera, a controller in Carla simulator is implemented which takes way-points as reference signal to navigate all the tracks.
The controller outputs vehicle throttle, brake, and steering angle commands.
